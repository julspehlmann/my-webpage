          <p>Hey friends, welcome to my website! In case you missed my giant name in the heading of this page, my name is Julia Spehlmann.
            I am a senior at UMass Lowell, majoring in Computer Science. When I'm not studying, you can catch me at the beach playing volleyball,
            hanging out with my two dogs (Red and Blue), sewing bracelets, or shopping at <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joes.</a> I love
            to travel, animals, and cooking.</p>
          <h1> <a id="uml">UML </a></h1>
          <p> I'm currently pursuing my second Bacelor's Degree at UMass Lowell. I've taken COMP I - IV, Logic Design, Assembly Programming
            Language, Analysis of Algorithms and several math classes. Last semester I spent 6 months as a Software Engineering co-op at
            <a href="https://www.curriculumassociates.com/">Curriculum Associates.</a>This semester I'm back at school taking GUI, Mobile Robotics,
            Foundations of Computer Science, Computer Architecture, and Symbolic Logic.

          <h1> <a id="gui">GUI </a></h1>
          <p>I hope to be a front-end engineer in the near future. GUI is my first step in learning all there is to know about web development.
            GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a web development course offered here at UML. It's also the first of a 2-part project sequence.
            So far, we've learned HTML and CSS. I'm super excited to start adding some JavaScript to this page! Interested in my GUI assignments?
            Thought so! Check them out here:
